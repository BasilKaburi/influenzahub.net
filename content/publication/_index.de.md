abstract_short: VeröffentlichungenAbstract Objectives To better understand the
  impact of comprehensive COVID-19 targeted non-pharmaceutical interventions
  (NPIs) on influenza burden worldwide.  Methods We conducted a systematic
  literature search in selected databases (PubMed, WHO COVID-19), preprint
  servers (medRxiv, bioRxiv) and websites of European Public Health institutes.
  Documents that compared influenza estimates in the 2019/2020 season with
  previous seasons were included. Information synthesis was qualitative due to a
  high heterogeneity in the number and periods of comparative seasons, outcome
  measures and statistical methods.  Results We included 23 records reporting
  from 15 countries/regions as well as 8 reports from European Public Health
  agencies. Estimates in the 2019/2020 season based on influenza virus tests (4
  out of 7 countries/regions), defined influenza cases (8 out of 9), influenza
  positivity rate (7 out of 8), and severe complications (1 out of 2) were lower
  than in former seasons. Results from syndromic indicators, such as
  influenza-like-illness (ILI), were less clear or even raised (4 out of 7)
  after the influenza season indicating a misclassification with COVID-19
  cases.  Conclusions Evidence synthesis suggests that NPIs targeted at
  SARS-CoV-2-transmission reduce influenza burden as well. Low threshold NPIs
  need to be more strongly emphasized in influenza prevention strategies.
